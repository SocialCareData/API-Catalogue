# API-Catalogue

Data exchange must happen between two or more parties, each with their own API endpoints. For the secure, trustworthy sharing of social care data through our data exchange mechanism, there needs to be a catalogue, or register, of all *authorised* parties -- known organisations in the world of social care -- and their API endpoints. Further information on each is important: what is their name? What do they do? Are they still active? Are their API endpoints live? What accreditation, or authorisation, do they have?

In this repository there is a specification for how organisations and their endpoints are presented in the API catalogue.
